            <h1>My Dearest Shreya ❤️</h1>

            <p>
                From the day you came into my life,
                everything changed.
                Ordinary days became beautiful.
                Simple moments became unforgettable.
            </p>

            <p>
                You are my calm in chaos,
                my smile in silence,
                my strength in weakness,
                and my happiness in every season.
            </p>

            <p>
                So today, I wanted to ask you something —
                in a way you’ll never forget.
            </p>
